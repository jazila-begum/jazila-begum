Hello, I’m Jazila! 👩‍💻🌸✨

I’m an AI & Data Science student who enjoys understanding how data turns into decisions and how models behave beyond just metrics. I like building systems that are clear, reliable, and genuinely useful—especially in machine learning, computer vision, and explainable AI, with hands-on experience in healthcare and security-focused applications.

Right now, I’m learning by doing: working on live industry projects, experimenting with modern deep learning models, and chasing ideas wherever they lead ☁️ —while staying grounded in real-world impact.
