# Hi, I’m Jazila!

I’m a **AI & Data Science** student who enjoys understanding how data turns into decisions and how models behave beyond just accuracy metrics. I like building systems that are clear, reliable, and genuinely useful—especially in **machine learning, computer vision, and explainable AI** with experience in building models focused on healthcare and security.

Right now, I’m learning by doing: working on live industry projects, experimenting with modern deep learning models, and **chasing ideas wherever they lead**, while staying grounded in real-world impact.
